cjk-tokenizer
=============

Extract terms from CJK text. The origin idea is stolen from [timdream/wordfreq](https://github.com/timdream/wordfreq).

## Why?

A CJK text tokenizer that works as expected is missing in the javascript magic world. So I decided to build one with these features:

* Chinese, Japanese and Korean support
* Terms extracted would contain score, position in origin text, etc.
* A more common stop words collection

## Install

Use in project:

```shell
npm i cjk-tokenizer --save
```

Cli:

```shell
npm i cjk-tokenizer -g
```
